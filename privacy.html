          <li>

            and subscription status.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sync storage details (WebDAV URL/credentials)</strong>:
            Stored locally in secure storage and never sent to us or anyone
            else; used only to remember your sync settings.

            <strong>User task data and settings</strong>: Stored and synced
            using your provided WebDAV server. We do not host or access this
